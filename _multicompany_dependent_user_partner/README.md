# Users with company-dependent partner

This module implements company_dependent partner_id on model res.users.

## Why?

With strict security between companies, a user with access to multiple non-related
companies should have a partner per company. This could be e.g. a support user or an
accountant.

## How to install?

Apply patches:

- git apply
  /path/to/multicompany_dependent_user_partner/multicompany_dependent_user_partner.patch
- git commit

For new database: Restart Odoo, create a new database, install the module

- python odoo-bin -i multicompany_dependent_user_partner -d MYDATABASE

For existing database:

- Run SQL: "UPDATE ir_module_module SET state = 'to install' WHERE name = 'base';"
  (state must be 'to install', not 'uninstalled')
- python odoo-bin -i base,multicompany_dependent_user_partner -d MYDATABASE

## How to use?

Create a new company (ignore the security error). Go to a list view, e.g. Companies or
Users (to avoid another security error). Select the new company in the top right
dropdown menu. Go to Users. Do for each user:

- Edit
- A) Write a name and select a language (will create a new partner)
- B) Select an existing partner
- Save

## Bugs

res.users temp_partner_id should be deleted. I see no method in openupgradelib to
completely delete a field! (Just the db column...)

In mail/models/mail_message.py check_access_rule(), I wanted to check if user partner
exists, and if not, raise UserError. But creating a user partner will trigger this very
method, then I get error because the partner does not exist.
