To configure this module, go to the menu *Invoicing > Configuration > Accounting > Account Types* and edit each account type to configure the correct *Policy for Partner Field*.

If you want a specific policy for some accounts, you can set the *Policy for Partner Field* directly on these accounts. If the field on the account is not set, Odoo will read the field on the related account type.
