FIRST prepare the Excel document.
The transactions should be together, no "non-transaction" row between.
Delete unnecessary rows.

Suggestion: Create two extra transaction lines (see vipps_demo.xlsx):

- One line for the transaction fees
- One line for the total bank transfer (transactions minus the transaction fees)
- Column A: To format the date as text, write ' before the date: '31.12.2022
- Column B: Write a description
- Column G: Write the amount (negative number)

THEN go to the Invoicing Dashboard.
(First time first create a bank journal.)

- Create and save a new bank statement.
- Action - Import Vipps - Upload your file - Import
