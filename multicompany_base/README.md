# Multicompany Base

Base module to have one multicompany database instead of multiple databases.

For each model:

- Creating company_id field (except on company model).
- Assigning (almost) every record to a company.
- Creating security rules.

For each company:

- Creating some necessary records.

## Why?

With very small, very similar companies, it might be easier to manage them all in one
database.

## The Security Action

The security action will make sure that:

- A user cannot access any data which is not belonging to the active company or its
  parent/child companies.
- A company manager can access all data in the active company and its parent/child
  companies.

## The Config Action

The configure company action will:

- create a company mail channel for all employees
- copy system sequences with code
- create default user
- create public user
- create website See multicompany_config.py for updated info.

## How to install?

First apply the patch:

- git apply /path/to/multicompany_base/multicompany_base.patch
- git commit

Then install this module

Finally, you may want to set these parameters in Settings - Technical - Parameters -
System parameters:

- multicompany_base.force_security = 1 -- Update the security every time Odoo is loaded
  or a module is installed or updated.
- multicompany_base.force_config = 1 -- Update for the configuration of all companies
  every time Odoo is loaded or a module is installed or updated. It will also
  auto-configure a new company. The 'Support User' has access to all companies and will
  do this configuration.

Hard coded:

- SYSTEM_COMPANY_ID = 1

## How to manually apply security & configuration?

There are two new menu items in Settings - Technical - Security:

- Force security
- Force configure all companies

In company form view, there is a button: Auto-Configure.

## How to manage companies and users?

Create a new company (ignore the security error). Go to a list view, e.g. Companies or
Users (to avoid another security error). Select the new company in the top right
dropdown menu. Go to Users (if multicompany_dependent_user_partner is installed). Do for
each user:

- Edit
- A) Write a name and select a language (will create a new partner)
- B) Select an existing partner
- Save

## Security vulnerabilities

Users may run untrusted code in server actions, salary rules, tax rules etc. Additional
security for save_eval will forbid certain text phrases in the untrusted code. Private
methods are forbidden except in superuser mode.

If 'odoo.tools.safe_eval.wrap_module' exists in an Odoo module, a python module is
whitelisted for safe_eval. Check the security of the python module before using the Odoo
module.

Below are some methods of the ORM. If they exist in an Odoo module, check the security
of the code before using the module. .sudo() .with_company() .with_context() .with_env()
.with_prefetch() .with_user()

## Bugs

Error in log just after creating a new company. Add company id to URL cids to avoid
access error. (This doesn't work: self.env.companies = new_company # The new environment
"stops" in the api.py call_kw_model_create.)

res.users temp_partner_id should be deleted. I see no method in openupgradelib to
completely delete a field! (Just the db column...)

## Roadmap

Import company from another database. Export company to another database.

## How to contribute?

You are very welcome to help with the tasks in the roadmap! Please sign the OCA document
(I would like to move the repo to OCA).
